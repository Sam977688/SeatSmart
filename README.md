# SeatSmart
A structured basic seat reservation system developed exclusively for COM244 students. It is designed to assist in the organized allocation of seats in computer laboratories and lecture rooms. Managed and finalized by the professor, the system ensures fairness and order by setting clear limitations on seat availability and access.
